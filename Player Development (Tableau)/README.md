My goal for this project was to determine (and visualize) which statistics early in a player's career are predictors of future success (using Excel and Tableau). The step-by-step explanation of the project is contained in the Microsoft Word document, with the corresponding Excel tables and PowerPoint presentation also attached (the Tableau files could not be posted on Github, but the most relevant ones are contained in the presentation, and I'm happy to send the full files to anyone who would like to see them).
