My goal for this project was to build two machine learning models in Python (one for hitters, and one for pitchers) with features based exclusively on traditional baseball statistics that would do a better job of predicting who the Baseball Writers' Association of America would elect to the National Baseball Hall of Fame than similar models built solely on advanced statistics. I succeeded in doing this using Random Forest (achieving cross-validation and testing accuracies above 95% for my hitting model and above 97% for my pitching model, with the caveat that each dataset is skewed with about 88% non-Hall of Famers vs. 12% Hall of Famers), and the entire process is illustrated in the attached Python notebook.
