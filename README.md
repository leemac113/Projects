Hall of Fame Project:  My goal for this project was to build two machine learning models (one for hitters, and one for pitchers) with features based exclusively on traditional baseball statistics that would do a better job of predicting who the Baseball Writers' Association of America would elect to the National Baseball Hall of Fame than similar models built solely on advanced statistics.  I succeeded in doing this using Random Forest, and the results are contained within!
