# Projects
Hall of Fame:  My goal for this project was to build two machine learning models in Python (one for hitters, and one for pitchers) with features based exclusively on traditional baseball statistics that would do a better job of predicting who the Baseball Writers' Association of America would elect to the National Baseball Hall of Fame than similar models built solely on advanced statistics.  I succeeded in doing this using Random Forest, and the entire process is illustrated in the attached Python notebook.

Player Development:  My goal for this project was to determine which statistics/benchmarks early in a player's career are predictors of future success (using Excel and Tableau).  The step-by-step explanation of the project is contained in the Microsoft Word document, with the corresponding Excel tables, Tableau visualizations, and PowerPoint presentation also attached.
