This project involved querying a database of Iowa liquor sales using SQL. In this exercise, I am pitching an idea for a marketing campaign to my boss based on an analysis of which liquor types generate more revenue, what the breakdown is by county (and county size) to see where these liquor types might have the most growth opportunity, what times of year these liquor types sell best, and finally looking for the most successful vendors to see who we might partner with. The overall plan is summarized in the "bossemail" Word document, the PowerPoint is the final presentation of the plan, and the full step-by-step breakdown and list of SQL queries is contained in the "projectqueries" text file.
